Conquest of Orion
=================

Javascript based clicker game. I built this to practice writing Javascript with DOM/CSS manipulation. It is close to done but there are still a couple of things to fix. It also needs some play testing. Suggestions are welcome and help.

#TODO
- Add win conditions when Orion is conquered
- Fix save/load to show buttons that should be visible.
- Playtest
